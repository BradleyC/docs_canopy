# Canopy Culture
Canopy is a place for authentic human community.

Authenticity breeds freedom, creativity, and _fun_.

The stronger we start out, the more powerful the response will be.

Our expectation for the initial community caretakers is to sculpt their communities toward authenticity. This includes:

* Keeping a close eye on new posts, and being sure to vote up or down as appropriate.
* Ensuring that there are always posts to discuss, adding posts when needed.
* Keeping the tone light and positive, through example and through moderation.
