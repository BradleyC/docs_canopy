# Why Test
Currently, Canopy is a bundle of instinct and informed guesses. 

Experience shows that the key to success is to get a product in front of users early and iterate from there.

For that reason, we're planning to kick off user testing the week of 12/17, and follow that up as quickly as possible with a prototype for further online testing.

# The Questions
The whole project hinges on the economy - will people vote? Will people only boost or only burn? How will we best keep the conversation flowing?

# The Test
Our offline MVP test consists of:
* 3 - 6 players, ideally 5
* Poker chips allocated to each participant (serving as tokens)
* Several party games to facilitate conversation
* Snacks / drinks, to thank folks for participating

Using prompt based card games (such as Cards Against Humanity), each player will create a "post" that other players will secretly vote on. Once each player has chosen their vote (including no vote), everyone will reveal at once.

The host will then calculate everyone's vote and distribute the pot accordingly.

# Hypotheses
* Engagement will spur engagement (steady increase in vote quantity and vote volume over time)
* Players will feel like they got a good value for their money
* The process overall will return profit back to the Canopy bank (from seeding player accounts -> windfall events)

# Results
Players will be asked to record their vote for each round.

The host will be recording the totals of each round of voting.

# Session planning
The more the better!

We'll be looking to hold at least 2 test sessions a week from the time the prototype is ready to alpha launch.

# Additional Goals
These tests should be _fun_: they should give the full experience of participating in Canopy. We should be building energy to be taken online into the product.

We'll also ask players to host us for future test sessions. We want to get in front of as many people as possible as quickly as possible. Hosts may get a token reward for their participation.

Ultimately, we feel that the personal connections established in these tests will help build the base for an authentic online community.
